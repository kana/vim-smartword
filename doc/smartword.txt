INTRODUCTION					*smartword-introduction*

*smartword* is a Vim plugin to provide {motion}s on |word|s which are smarter
than the built-in ones in some sense.  For example, |w| moves the cursor to
the next word as follows (here "#" means a position to which |w| moves the
cursor for each time):

	<a href="http://www.vim.org/">www.vim.org</a>
	 # #   # #   #  #  ##  ##  #  #  ##  ##  # #

Because there are two types of words and |w| moves to the next word which can
be the both types.  Let's call "L" for a type of words and "P" for another
type of words, where "L" means a word which consists of a sequence of letters
(which are defined by 'iskeyword' option) and "P" means a word which consists
of a sequence of other non-blank characters.

In many cases, you might want to move to the next "L", not "P".  This plugin
provides {motion}s to behave so.  For example, |<Plug>(smartword-w)| which is
corresponding to |w| moves the cursor as follows:

	<a href="http://www.vim.org/">www.vim.org</a>
	 # #     #      #   #   #     #   #   #    #

See also |smartword-examples| for customization.

INTERFACE					*smartword-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*smartword-mappings*

<Plug>(smartword-w)				*<Plug>(smartword-w)*
<Plug>(smartword-b)				*<Plug>(smartword-b)*
<Plug>(smartword-e)				*<Plug>(smartword-e)*
<Plug>(smartword-ge)				*<Plug>(smartword-ge)*
			Smart versions of |w|, |b|, |e| and |ge|.
			These mappings are defined in Normal mode, Visual mode
			and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(smartword-basic-w)			 *<Plug>(smartword-basic-w)*
<Plug>(smartword-basic-b)			 *<Plug>(smartword-basic-b)*
<Plug>(smartword-basic-e)		         *<Plug>(smartword-basic-e)*
<Plug>(smartword-basic-ge)		         *<Plug>(smartword-basic-ge)*
			Basic motions on words.  These are equivalent to |w|,
			|b|, |e| and |ge| by default.  These are used to
			implement smart motions such as |<Plug>(smartword-w)|.
			These mappings are defined in Normal mode, Visual mode
			and Operator-pending mode.

			You can customize these mappings to tweak smartword to
			behave based on custom motions.  See also
			|smartword-examples|.




==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*smartword-examples*

(A) Replace |w| and others with |smartword-mappings|:
>
	map w  <Plug>(smartword-w)
	map b  <Plug>(smartword-b)
	map e  <Plug>(smartword-e)
	map ge  <Plug>(smartword-ge)
<

(B) Use other key sequences for smart version:
>
	map ,w  <Plug>(smartword-w)
	map ,b  <Plug>(smartword-b)
	map ,e  <Plug>(smartword-e)
	map ,ge  <Plug>(smartword-ge)
<

(C) Keep the default meanings of |w| and others in other key sequences:
>
	noremap ,w  w
	noremap ,b  b
	noremap ,e  e
	noremap ,ge  ge
<

(D) Use CamelCaseMotion https://github.com/bkad/CamelCaseMotion as basic
wordwise motions, but skip uninteresting punctuations as smartword does:
>
	map <Plug>(smartword-basic-w)  <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_w
	map <Plug>(smartword-basic-b)  <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_b
	map <Plug>(smartword-basic-e)  <Plug>CamelCaseMotion_e
<
You also have to define key mappings to use smartword like example (A) or (B).
Note that CamelCaseMotion does not provide a custom motion behaves like |ge|.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*smartword-bugs*

						*smartword-w-over-lines*
- `dw` is equivalent to `vwhd` in most of situations.  But there is an
  exception.  If `w` moves the cursor to another line, it acts as `$`.
  Suppose that the current buffer contains the following text:
>
      1|foo bar
      2|  baz
      3|qux
<
  Typing `w` on "bar" moves the cursor to "baz".  But `dw` on "bar" deletes
  only "bar" instead of "bar\n  ".  The same can be said for other operators.

  |<Plug>(smartword-w)| tries emulating this exceptional behavior of |w|.  But
  this emulation is a bit tricky.  If you notice that something goes wrong,
  please report it via: https://github.com/kana/vim-smartword/issues

- Don't consider about special cases such as |cw|.

- |o_v| and others don't work for |<Plug>(smartword-e)| and
  |<Plug>(smartword-ge)| because of the limitation of Vim script.

  Note that if the following patch is applied to Vim, |o_v| and others work
  for both motions.  But |o_v| with empty selection still doesn't work.
