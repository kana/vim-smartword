  " `dw` is equivalent to `vwhd` in most of situations.  But there is an
  " exception.  If `w` moves the cursor to another line, it acts as `$`.
  " Suppose that the current buffer contains the following text:
  "
  "     1|foo bar
  "     2|  baz
  "     3|qux
  "
  " Typing `w` on "bar" moves the cursor to "baz".
  " But `dw` on "bar" deletes only "bar" instead of "bar\n  ".
  " The same can be said for other operators.
  "
  " vim-smartword tries emulating this exception if necessary.

    " Here we have to use `$` to emulate the exceptional behavior of `dw`.
    " Though `$` is an inclusive motion, this function is executed in
    " a context of `:` in Operator-pending mode, and a resulting motion by
    " this function is treated as exclusive.  So that we have to use also `v`
    " to target a proper region.
